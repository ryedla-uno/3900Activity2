                I'm here in the USA to pursue Masters in MIS at UNO and this is my first semester.
                Recently I visited Baxter Arena as I heard that there would be so many sport events
                conducting every year. So, I went for to explore what are the different sports are
                used to play there. I get to know that there consists a basket ball court, volley
                ball court and Ice Hockey court. It's my first experience to see Ice hockey court
                at fields. So, I'm very excited about it.
